columnz
=======
HTML tables are common for viewing columnar data on a web page. However, sometimes there may be columns you do not necessarily want to see. Enter the Columnz, a jQuery plug-in, and let your users choose which columns they want to see. Simply include the columnz.js and columnz.css files into your project, and wire up a simple call in your document ready function.
When applied to a table, each table header will receive a close icon that appears on mouseover. The table itself will be moved very slightly to the right to make room for a small dropdown menu icon that can be used to hide and restore columns.
